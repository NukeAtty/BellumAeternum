					<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
					<p>Currently, Bellum Æternum is closing to apply for alpha test before release. Now, I want to share some critical information about how the mod is going.</p>
					<p>Before we jump to the details, I want to clarify the goal for the first version. As we know, high quality modding is a long hiking. Bellum Æternum is a mod that will reshuffle the Red Alert 2, almost a reconstruction. Therefore, the first version of this mod will be very basic:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Skirmish will be totally playable with fully developed mechanics.</li>
						<li>There will be 3 skirmish map published.</li>
						<li>All hidden elements that can be obtained or interacted will be fully functioning.</li>
						<li>Campaign won't be released until the first season finished.</li>
						<li>Minor art assets isn't completed, will be perfect in the future updates.</li>
						<li>No DTA Client and online battle, PvP can only be done through LAN (Local Area Networks).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>With understanding the list above, we can now go through the details.</p>
					<h2 id="skirmish-info">Skirmish</h2>
					<p>Detailed techtree and units specifications can be browsed through <a href="../archives.html">Archives</a> page, so here we will just go through the style of gameplay.</p>
					<p>Gameplay of Bellum Æternum will be very different from the original Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, for multiple reason listed below:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Infantries with rifles and machineguns can hardly deal damage to tanks, and can do slight damages to armoured car. For unarmoured vehicles like truck based <a href="../soviet.html#mobile-radar">Mobile Radar</a>, they can deal fair damage. For structures, rifles and machineguns can easily damage civilian buildings, and deal fair damage to defensive structures, but very less damage to military buildings such as a <a href="../allied.html#allied-weapon-factory">Weapon Factory</a></li>
						<li>Different cannon uses different types of ammunition, and they behaves differently, their traits are listeds below:
							<ul>
								<li>Armour Piercing: low bouncing rate, medium trajectory velocity, fair damage to buildings.</li>
								<li>Armour Piercing Compound Rigid: medium bouncing rate, high trajectory velocity, fair damage to buildings.</li>
								<li>High Explosive: no bouncing rate, low trajectory velocity, high damage to buildings.</li>
								<li>High Explosive Anti-Tank: no bouncing rate, low trajectory velocity, low damage to buildings.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Gameplay is slowed down since buildings and vehicles are more expensive than before.</li>
						<li>Crates isn't always buffs, pick it carefully.</li>
						<li>Veteran and elite units only improve slightly.</li>
						<li>Reshuffled tech tree and no navy.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All points above makes the gameplay a lot different from the vanilla Red Alert 2 or Yuri's Revenge.</p>
					<h2 id="new-features">New Feature of Bellum Æternum</h2>
					<p>There are tons of new features that make the mod fun to play, here I will make a brief list so you can experience them in the gameplay.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Units are in fair size.</li>
						<li>Optimised overall effectives, including burning effect, muzzle flame smoke, radiation dust etc.</li>
						<li>All vehicles have animated chassis.</li>
						<li>Vehicles leaves wrecks after destroyed.</li>
						<li>Brand new skirmish maps with lots of fun mechanics, such as train and natural disaster.</li>
						<li>Remastered AI which is challenging enough.</li>
						<li>Redesigned spy system.</li>
						<li>New special tactics for both sides.</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Things to Complete</h2>
					<p>Before the alpha test, there are still much to do:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>There are 6 voxel assets needed to be completed.</li>
						<li>The third skirmish map: Mt.Thunderhead is still working in process.</li>
						<li>The first skirmish map need some graphical improvement.</li>
						<li>Some icons for special tactics need to be completed.</li>
						<li>AI need some further improvement.</li>
						<li>Some vehicles needs wreck.</li>
						<li></li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
					<p>There are still much to do right now, and I hope all players with opportunity of the Alpha test can fully experience this game, and help me to make it better. </p>
					<p>The Alpha test will start at the end of September, the specific date will be published on both <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/bellum-aeternum" target="_blank">Mod DB</a> and here on the official site, so Stay tune.</p>
