# About This Site

This documentation platform demonstrates a lightweight approach to serving static content.

## Technologies Used:

* **HTML:** For the basic structure.
* **CSS:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For dynamic content loading and Markdown parsing.
* **HTMX:** For declarative dynamic content, especially for the reusable header, footer, and navigation.
* **marked.js:** A JavaScript library for parsing Markdown to HTML.

We believe in simplicity and efficiency, and this setup provides a robust base for small to medium-sized documentation needs without the overhead of complex build tools or server-side rendering.

Feel free to inspect the source code to understand how it works!
