How to Edit an IFV? 
With Yuri's Revenge
	Limit
		There is a annoying limitation for the original platform of Yuri's Revenge to edit an IFV, that is the unit can only be named as [FV]. Therefore, the only thing you can do is to edit the function of an IFV instead of create a new one. Also, the number of swapable modes are also limited to 18, so you must consider your design carefully.
	Weapon system
		The weapon system of an IFV is rather confusing. 
		First, you need a Gunner=yes tag.
		Second, you need to create several weapons with WeaponX flag for the IFV, to make it usable.
		X start with 1, so the Weapon1 is the original weapon for IFV.
		At last, you need to give all infantries that you want to influence the weapon on IFV a IFVMode= tag.
		The parameter for IFVMode= starts from 0, which means an infantry with IFVMode=0 uses the original weapon (Weapon1) of the IFV.
	Name system
		The name system of the IFV is also annoying. There are three options:
		1. Rocket IFV (original)
		2. Repair IFV (with Engineer)
		3. Machinegun IFV (with GI or Conscript)
		Everything else would named follow the rule below:
		1. If the infantry has UseOwnName=yes tag, the IFV will show the name of the content in front of its name.
		2. If the infantry has UseOwnName=no tag, the IFV will show as its original name, which is Rocket IFV.

With Ares
	No Limit
		With Ares, there won't be much limitation, which means you can add the IFV logic to any ground vehicle you want, and supports much more swapable modes to be added.
	Weapon system
		In Ares, the weapon system is different from the original one.
	Name system
		With Ares, you can customize name for all turret.
